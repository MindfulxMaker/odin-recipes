# Odin Recipes Project

This project is an exercise in the Foundation Courses of The Odin Project.
(https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes).

I can practice muscle memory on HTML boilerplate, using anchor tags, links, unordered lists and ordered lists.
For images, I follow best practice that including alt attribute and default width/height.


## How to write in this README?
Set up your README.md file and write a brief introduction describing what the current project is and what skills you will have demonstrated once you have completed it. (You can also do this as a self-reflection at the end of the project, which is a good way to review what you have learned.)
