    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>"This vegan potato curry has abundant spices that make this better than any restaurant curry I've tasted."</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
        <li>½ yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons curry powder</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garam masala</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ (1 inch) piece fresh ginger root, peeled and minced</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can garbanzo beans (chickpeas), rinsed and drained</li>
        <li>½ (15 ounce) can peas, drained</li>
        <li>½ (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>½ (14 ounce) can coconut milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Season with curry powder, garam masala, cumin, salt, ginger, and cayenne pepper; cook and stir for 2 minutes more.</li>
        <li>Add cooked potatoes, garbanzo beans, peas, and tomatoes, then pour in coconut milk. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
